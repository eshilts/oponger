    git clone git@github.com:opower/oponger.git /path/to/oponger

This will set the github repo as the "origin". To push your local changes from the "master" branch:
    git push origin master

To push the app to Google App Engine:

Running The App Locally
-----------------------
To run the app, you'll need to download and install Google App Engine Python SDK from:

Once you've installed it, you can run it from the command line, using:

Or, you can fire it up using the handy dandy GoogleAppEngineLauncher, which provides handy links to the
dashboard, logs, and more.
