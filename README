Implementation
--------------
The app is a basic Google App Engine Python application. For more info, check out http://code.google.com/appengine/


Source Repository
-----------------
https://github.com/opower/oponger
To check out oponger with git:
    git clone git@github.com:opower/oponger.git /path/to/oponger

This will set the github repo as the "origin". To push your local changes from the "master" branch:
    git push origin master

To push the app to Google App Engine:
    appcfg.py update /path/to/oponger


Running The App Locally
-----------------------
To run the app, you'll need to download and install Google App Engine Python SDK from:
    http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python

Once you've installed it, you can run it from the command line, using:
    dev_appserver.py /path/to/oponger

Or, you can fire it up using the handy dandy GoogleAppEngineLauncher, which provides handy links to the
dashboard, logs, and more.


Working With IntelliJ
---------------------
Once you've got the project checked out and Google App Engine Python SDK installed,
you can work with the project through IntelliJ.

* Install the Python Plugin
* Create a New Project
** Choose New Project, Python Module
** + to configure Python SDK
** Select your version of Python. On a Mac, this will be under System/Library/Frameworks/Versions/2.6/python
** Under "Please select the desired technologies", Select Google App Engine
** If asked for the Google App Engine SDK, under OSX that should be in
    /Applications/GoogleAppEngineLauncher.app/Contents/Resources/GoogleAppEngine-default.bundle/Contents/Resources/google_appengine


Testing
-------
To run a unit test:
    cd test
    python <test_name>
